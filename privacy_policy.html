  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>VetAIHealth</strong> application respects and protects your privacy. 
    This policy explains how we collect, use, and manage your data.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The application only collects information you voluntarily provide, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos of your pet.</li>
    <li>Descriptions of symptoms or health-related issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This information is used exclusively for analysis by the AI system and is 
    <strong>not shared</strong> with any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
  <p>
    The data you submit is used solely to generate an assessment of potential 
    health issues for your pet. It is not permanently stored or used for commercial 
    or advertising purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    All communications with the server are secured via HTTPS. 
    We do not store any sensitive data on our servers beyond the duration 
    required for analysis.
  </p>

  <div class="disclaimer">
    ⚠️ <strong>Medical Disclaimer:</strong><br>
    The <strong>VetAIHealth</strong> app provides AI-based assessments of potential 
    pet health issues based on the photo and description you submit. 
    It does not replace clinical examination or professional veterinary advice. 
    For an accurate diagnosis and treatment, always consult your veterinarian.
  </div>

  <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to request the deletion of your data at any time. 
    Since we do not permanently store any user data, all submitted information 
    is automatically deleted after the analysis is completed.
  </p>
